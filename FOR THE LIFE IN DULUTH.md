# FOR THE LIFE IN DULUTH

### July 23, 2017

I met with my Pi and talked about our project that will be a great thing. But since he had some doubts for the project and aims I choose but that's fine. I have the backup plan for this. We need to figure out the connection not only in the research field, we need them to be beneficial for the medical area to be useful and could be compatible in clinical study.

That's one problem. Another thing is that the lab is starting up so the funding is not quite sufficient but that' fine since we have the opportunity to improve that in the further now we could feel that we have the more faith to improve the status and the research should be done in this environment. But anyway, the deparment here is well organized and easier to get accesss to. That should be good to know.
